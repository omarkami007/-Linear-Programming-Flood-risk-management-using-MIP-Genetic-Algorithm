# Flood Risk Management: Optimizing Barrier Placement Using Operations Research

This repository contains the implementation of advanced **Operations Research techniques** to tackle the critical problem of flood risk management. The project focuses on optimizing the placement and minimal number of barriers required to protect key assets from flooding, leveraging mathematical modeling and optimization strategies.

## Overview

Floods pose a significant risk to critical infrastructure and assets. This project develops two innovative algorithms that address this challenge by employing:

1. **Linear Programming (Simplex Method):** Applied to small datasets for precise optimization.
2. **Genetic Algorithms (GAs):** Designed for scalability, handling larger datasets efficiently.

The goal is to minimize the cost and maximize the effectiveness of flood barriers, ensuring optimal resource allocation in flood-prone areas.
