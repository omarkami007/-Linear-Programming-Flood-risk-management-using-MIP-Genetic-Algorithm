### Flood Risk Management: Optimizing Barrier Placement Using Operations Research

This repository contains the implementation of **Operations Research techniques** to tackle the problem of flood risk management. The project focuses on optimizing the placement and minimal number of barriers required to protect key assets from flooding. By formulating the task as an optimization (minimization) problem, it is solved using either deterministic methods like the Simplex Algorithm or metaheuristic approaches such as Genetic Algorithms.

#### Overview

Floods pose a significant risk to critical infrastructure and assets. This project develops two algorithms that address this challenge by employing:

1. **Linear Programming (Simplex Method):** Applied to small datasets for precise optimization.
2. **Genetic Algorithms (GAs):** Designed for scalability, handling larger datasets efficiently.
